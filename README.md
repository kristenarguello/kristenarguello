## 👋 Hi, I'm Kristen Arguello!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student in the final semesters of my degree at PUCRS (Brazil), passionate about exploring the inner workings of computing — from the low-level details of how compilers and operating systems work, to the high-level design of intelligent systems.

🧠 My main interests include:
- **Backend development** — building scalable, reliable, and well-structured systems.
- **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** — I'm not only excited about building applications powered by ML, but also deeply curious about *how* models work under the hood: their architectures, training dynamics, and theoretical foundations.
- **Core Computer Science concepts** — I'm fascinated by how computers *really* work: from Universal Turing Machines to memory management, virtual machines, and beyond.

👩‍💻 I enjoy working on projects that challenge both my engineering and research sides — from writing Linux kernel modules and interpreters, to experimenting with LLMs and building RAG pipelines for real-world use.

🔭 I'm always learning and looking to collaborate on impactful and technically engaging projects. Check out some of the things I’ve been working on below!
